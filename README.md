# Extended Education Org Chart

Welcome to the Extended Education Org Chart! The aim is to keep this as simple as possible to maintain: 99% of the time, the only file that should need to be updated is [this one](https://github.com/ExtendedEducation/org-chart/blob/master/misc/data.csv). 

## Giving editing access to someone new

This must be done by someone with full access (currently Hayley and Louise).

1. Click the 'Settings' link in the github menu bar (or [click here](https://github.com/ExtendedEducation/org-chart/settings/access).)
2. Under 'manage access' click 'add people'.
3. Type in their email address, then click on it.
4. Select 'write' access, then 'Add selection'.
5. This will invite them to create a github account, then give them editing access to the repository.

## To add new members to the team

Add each new member as a new line, in the following format, with no spaces between the commas or at the end of the line:

> ID number of new staff member (these can just increase sequentially),Full Name,ID number of the staff member's line manager,Job Title (surrounded in quote marks if it includes commas or ampersands,Department

So, for instance:

> 2,Philippa Swindell,1,"Associate Director, Commercial Operations & Planning",SLT

## Update members of the team

If a team member leaves (and is replaced by someone else), or their job title or reporting line changes, simply change the entry in the existing list. 

Lines can be deleted if the role is no longer required (but if the person is a line manager, make sure you change the reporting lines of their team as well).
